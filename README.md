For the "Communication Engineering Principles" assignment, I worked on designing and simulating different amplitude modulation techniques using MATLAB and Simulink. The focus was on three key modulation schemes: Double Sideband Full Carrier (DSBFC), Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSBSC), and Single Sideband (SSB) modulation. The project involved building circuit designs for each modulation type, performing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tests, and analyzing the results.

In the DSBFC model, I implemented full AM modulation and demodulation circuits and explored the effects of varying modulation indexes. For DSBSC, I designed circuits without the carrier, focusing on the sidebands for signal transmission. In SSB, I isolated one sideband using filters. Each modulation type was subjected to SNR testing to observe how different noise levels impacted the signal quality.

The assignment showcased the behavior of various modulation techniques, their advantages, and their challenges when dealing with noise in communication systems.
